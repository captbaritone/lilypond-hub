What is LilypondHub?
====================

Inspired by the possibilities that open source music scores present, I decided
to start an index of all known Lilypond music on Github.

To begin with, I am simply collecting any repository that contains Lilypond
typeset music.

How can I help?
===============

I've surely missed some great projects. You can help by showing me repositories
I have missed by either reporting it in the issue tracker, or submitting a pull
request.
